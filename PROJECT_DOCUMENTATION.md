## 1. Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end customer churn prediction system for a telecom business using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers, 21 raw columns). The business problem it solves is identifying customers who are likely to cancel their service before they actually leave, so retention teams can intervene early. The system covers the full ML lifecycle: exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter notebook, a preprocessing pipeline that cleans and encodes the raw data, a training script that compares two classifiers and selects the better one by F1-score, a FastAPI inference service that accepts raw customer attributes and returns a churn probability with a risk label, and a static HTML/CSS/JS dashboard that lets a user fill in a customer profile, call the API live, and see the result alongside EDA-derived insights and model performance metrics.

## 3. Complete Workflow

Steps in the exact order the pipeline runs.

### Step 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (`notebooks/01_eda.ipynb`)

Performed in a Jupyter notebook using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The notebook is a binary `.ipynb` file; its findings are documented in `README.md` and reflected in the dashboard's hardcoded chart values. Key findings recorded:

- Dataset is moderately imbalanced: 73.46% no-churn, 26.54% churn
- `TotalCharges` contained 11 blank-string values requiring coercion to `NaN`
- Contract type is a strong churn predictor: month-to-month customers churn at ~42.7%, one-year at ~11.3%, two-year at ~2.8%
- Tenure is a strong predictor: 0–12 month customers churn at ~47.4%, declining to ~6.6% at 61–72 months
- Fiber optic internet customers churn at ~41.9% vs DSL at ~19.0% vs no service at ~7.4%
- Churning customers have higher average monthly charges and lower average tenure

### Step 2 — Preprocessing (`model/preprocess.py`)

Runs as a standalone script (`python model/preprocess.py`). Exact steps from the code:

1. Loads `data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` using a path relative to the script's location via `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]`
2. Converts `TotalCharges` to numeric with `pd.to_numeric(..., errors="coerce")`, turning blank strings into `NaN`
3. Drops rows where `TotalCharges` is `NaN` using `dropna(subset=["TotalCharges"])`
4. Drops the `customerID` column
5. Maps `Churn` to binary integers: `Yes → 1`, `No → 0`
6. Separates features (`X`) from target (`y`)
7. One-hot encodes all `object`/`category`/`string` dtype columns using `pd.get_dummies(..., drop_first=True)`
8. Splits into train/test with `test_size=0.2`, `stratify=y`, `random_state=42`
9. Casts `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges` to `float`
10. Fits `StandardScaler` on training numeric columns only, then transforms both train and test
11. Saves to `model/` via `joblib.dump`: `X_train.pkl`, `X_test.pkl`, `y_train.pkl`, `y_test.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `feature_columns.pkl`

### Step 3 — Model Training (`model/train.py`)

Runs as a standalone script (`python model/train.py`). Exact steps from the code:

1. Loads the four split artifacts from `model/` via `joblib.load`
2. Trains `LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)` — no other hyperparameters set
3. Trains `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)` — no other hyperparameters set
4. Evaluates both models on `X_test`/`y_test` using `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, and `confusion_matrix`
5. Prints a side-by-side comparison table
6. Computes top-10 feature importances from the Random Forest and saves a horizontal bar chart to `model/feature_importance.png` at 150 DPI using `matplotlib.use("Agg")`
7. Selects the final model using: `if random_forest_results["f1_score"] > logistic_results["f1_score"]` — the model with the strictly higher F1-score wins; ties go to Logistic Regression
8. Saves the winning model to `model/churn_model.pkl`
9. Writes `model/model_info.json` with the winning model's name, four rounded metrics, and `date.today().isoformat()`

### Step 4 — API (`api/main.py`)

Started with `uvicorn api.main:app --reload` from the project root. On startup:

- Loads `churn_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, and `feature_columns.pkl` once into module-level variables
- Defines `numeric_columns = ["tenure", "MonthlyCharges", "TotalCharges"]`

On each `POST /predict` request, `prepare_input_data()` runs:

1. Calls `customer.model_dump()` to get a plain dict
2. If `TotalCharges` is `None`, sets it to `tenure * MonthlyCharges`
3. Converts the dict to a one-row `pd.DataFrame`
4. Encodes with `pd.get_dummies(input_df, drop_first=False)` — **not** `drop_first=True`
5. Reindexes to `feature_columns` with `fill_value=0`
6. Casts numeric columns to `float`
7. Applies `scaler.transform()` to the three numeric columns only
8. Returns the aligned DataFrame to `predict()`

### Step 5 — Dashboard (`dashboard/`)

Opened directly as a static file in a browser (`dashboard/index.html`). No local server required. On load, `initEDACharts()` renders three static bar charts. On form submit, `buildPayload()` reads the form, casts types, and calls `fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict", ...)`. On response, `renderResult(data, payload)` updates the result panel.

## 4. Exact Model Results

Pulled directly from `model/model_info.json` (winning model) and `model/train.py` (comparison logic and README table for the losing model).

### From `model_info.json` (Logistic Regression — selected model)

```json
{
  "chosen_model": "Logistic Regression",
  "accuracy": 0.8045,
  "precision": 0.6505,
  "recall": 0.5722,
  "f1_score": 0.6088,
  "date_trained": "2026-07-29"
}
```

### From `README.md` model comparison table (Random Forest — not selected)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.7868 |
| Precision | 0.6225 |
| Recall | 0.5027 |
| F1-score | 0.5562 |

> Note: The Random Forest metrics in the README were recorded at training time. They are not stored in `model_info.json` (which only records the winning model). The `train.py` code prints both sets of metrics to stdout but only persists the winner.

### Selection criterion

From `train.py` line: `if random_forest_results["f1_score"] > logistic_results["f1_score"]`. Since `0.5562 < 0.6088`, the condition was false and Logistic Regression was selected. The rationale stated in comments: F1-score is preferred over accuracy for imbalanced churn data because it balances false positives and false negatives.

## 5. The One-Hot Encoding Bug

### What the bug was

During training in `preprocess.py`, `pd.get_dummies(..., drop_first=True)` is applied to the full 7,000+ row dataset. With many rows, every categorical column has multiple distinct values present, so `drop_first=True` drops one reference category per column and produces a stable, complete feature schema.

The original API code applied the same `drop_first=True` to a single-row inference DataFrame. With only one row, each categorical column has exactly one value present. `drop_first=True` on a single-category column drops that one value entirely — it has nothing to compare against. This silently erased dummy columns for whichever category happened to be submitted, including high-signal churn indicators such as:

- `InternetService_Fiber optic`
- `PaymentMethod_Electronic check`
- `PaperlessBilling_Yes`
- `MultipleLines_Yes`

The subsequent `reindex(columns=feature_columns, fill_value=0)` then filled those missing columns back in as zeros, making the model treat a Fiber optic / Electronic check / Month-to-month customer as if they had none of those attributes. High-risk customers were scored artificially low.

### How it was fixed

The fix is documented in `api/main.py` comments and the README. The change was:

**Before:**
```python
encoded_df = pd.get_dummies(input_df, drop_first=True)
```

**After:**
```python
encoded_df = pd.get_dummies(input_df, drop_first=False)
```

With `drop_first=False`, all present dummy columns are created. The `reindex` step that follows still handles alignment to the training schema — adding zeros for any categories not present in this single request, and dropping any unexpected columns. The fix also confirmed that `reindex` must happen before `scaler.transform`, which is the order in the current code.

A second fix added at the same time: `TotalCharges` was made `Optional[float]` in the `CustomerData` Pydantic model, with a fallback of `tenure * MonthlyCharges` when it is `None`.

**Submit button:** "Predict Churn" with inline CSS spinner (border animation) that replaces the text during loading. Button is disabled while loading.

**Error display:** `#form-error` div shown with red background when fetch fails or API returns non-200. Exact message for connection failure: "Cannot reach the API. Make sure the FastAPI server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000". Cleared on each new submission attempt.

### Right panel — Result display

**Empty state (shown before first prediction):**
- Icon + "Churn Risk Analyzer" title + one-sentence model description
- "How it works" tinted card with a 3-step numbered stepper: (1) Enter customer details, (2) Model analyzes patterns, (3) Get churn probability
- CTA line: "← Fill in the form and click Predict Churn"

**Result state (shown after prediction, replaces empty state):**
- Eyebrow label: "RESULTS"
- Heading: "Prediction Result"
- Churn probability percentage — animated with ease-out cubic count-up over 350ms using `requestAnimationFrame`; animates from the previous value on repeated predictions
- Risk badge — pill shape with icon prefix (✓ for Low, ▲ for Medium/High) and color coding: green (`#dcfce7` / `#16a34a`) for Low, amber (`#fef3c7` / `#b45309`) for Medium, red (`#fee2e2` / `#dc2626`) for High
- Chart.js doughnut chart — two segments: Churn (red `#dc2626`) and Retention (green `#16a34a`), `cutout: "70%"`, legend at bottom, tooltip shows percentage. Previous chart instance is destroyed before each new render via `doughnutChart.destroy()`
- Verdict line — "⚠️ This customer is likely to churn (X% probability)." or "✅ This customer is likely to stay (X% churn probability)."
- "Key risk factors" detail block — rule-based text derived from submitted form values; checks 9 conditions (month-to-month contract, tenure ≤ 12, Fiber optic, no OnlineSecurity, no TechSupport, Electronic check, PaperlessBilling=Yes, MonthlyCharges ≥ 70, SeniorCitizen=1); returns up to 4 matching factors as a comma-separated string
- "Recommended action" detail block — three fixed strings keyed by risk level: High → "Consider proactive retention outreach — offer a contract upgrade or loyalty discount.", Medium → "Monitor engagement over the next billing cycle and consider a check-in call.", Low → "No immediate action needed — this customer shows low churn risk."
- Fade-slide-in animation (300ms ease) on the result panel on each new prediction, re-triggered via forced reflow (`void resultContent.offsetWidth`)

### Model metrics strip

Eyebrow: "MODEL PERFORMANCE". Heading: "Logistic Regression — Test Set Results". Four metric cards with hover lift effect:
- Accuracy: 80.45%
- Precision: 65.05%
- Recall: 57.22%
- F1-Score: 60.88%

Values are hardcoded in HTML, sourced from `model_info.json`.

### Key Insights section

Eyebrow: "EDA FINDINGS". Three Chart.js bar charts with hover lift on cards, labeled "based on training data analysis":

1. **Churn Rate by Contract Type** — bars: Month-to-month 42.7% (red), One year 11.3% (amber), Two year 2.8% (green)
2. **Churn Rate by Tenure Group** — bars: 0–12 mo 47.4%, 13–24 mo 35.2%, 25–48 mo 22.1%, 49–60 mo 14.8%, 61–72 mo 6.6% (all indigo `#4f46e5`)
3. **Churn Rate by Internet Service** — bars: Fiber optic 41.9% (red), DSL 19.0% (amber), No service 7.4% (green)

All three charts use `responsive: true`, `maintainAspectRatio: false`, no legend, percentage y-axis ticks.

### Footer

Two-column layout: left shows project name + training date; right shows "Built with Python · Scikit-learn · FastAPI · Chart.js" and a GitHub icon button (links to `#` — placeholder only).

### Responsive behavior

- ≤ 960px: two-column top grid collapses to single column; metrics and insights grids go to 2 columns
- ≤ 768px: field rows stack label above input; result main stacks vertically; insights grid goes to 1 column; header badge hidden
- ≤ 480px: font size reduced to 14px; padding tightened; metrics grid stays at 2 columns

## 8. Testing Performed

No formal test files (e.g. `pytest` test suite, `test_*.py` files) exist in the project. All testing was manual or ad-hoc via direct API calls and browser interaction.

### API validation — direct HTTP calls

A temporary Python script (`test_low_risk.py`) was written using `urllib.request` to POST the low-risk profile payload directly to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/predict` (note: port 8001, not 8000 — port 8000 was blocked by a Windows socket permission error during the session). The script was deleted after use. Confirmed result:

```json
{"churn_prediction": "No", "churn_probability": 0.0044, "risk_level": "Low"}
```

### Manual browser testing — three risk profiles

| Profile | Key inputs | Returned probability | Risk badge |
|---|---|---|---|
| High risk | tenure=2, Month-to-month, Fiber optic, Electronic check, MultipleLines=Yes, no security/support | ~82.3% | High |
| Medium risk | tenure=24, One year, mixed services | ~61.3% | Medium |
| Low risk | tenure=60, Two year, DSL, OnlineSecurity=Yes, TechSupport=Yes, Mailed check | 0.44% | Low |

The Medium result (61.3%) confirmed the 33–66% band is reachable in practice. The difference between the 61.3% result (MultipleLines=No) and the 82.3% result (MultipleLines=Yes) for otherwise similar high-risk profiles was identified and explained as a real model difference, not a bug.

### Error handling validation

Confirmed by code inspection (`script.js`): when `fetch()` throws a `TypeError` with "fetch" in the message (the browser's connection-refused error), `showError()` is called with the message "Cannot reach the API. Make sure the FastAPI server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000", which renders visibly in the `#form-error` div. Not a silent console-only failure.

### Chart redraw validation

Confirmed by code inspection (`script.js`): `renderDoughnut()` calls `doughnutChart.destroy()` before creating a new `Chart` instance on every prediction. The module-level `doughnutChart` variable is reassigned each time. No ghosting or overlapping rings possible.

### Known environment issue

Port 8000 was blocked on the development machine by a Windows socket permission error (`[WinError 10013]`). The API was run on port 8001 instead (`uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8001`). The dashboard `API_URL` constant in `script.js` still points to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — this would need updating if port 8001 is used consistently.
